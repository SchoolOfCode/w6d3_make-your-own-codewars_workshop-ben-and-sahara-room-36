No prime
Write a function that takes in an integer as a parameter. If it is a prime number it should return the next non-prime number. If it is a positive non-prime number, it should return itself. Whereas, if it is a negative number, it should return zero.

Prime numbers are special numbers, greater than 1, that have exactly two factors, themselves and 1.

For example 
1 ----> 1
2 ----> 4
4 ----> 4
7 ----> 8
-2 ----> 0
